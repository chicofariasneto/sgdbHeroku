## sgdbHeroku
📦⚙️ This is a repository to manager my databases from Heroku

### Why?

Heroku doesn't have a good tool to manage the database of an application, so I am developing this project to manage the databases of my projects that run on Heroku, and obviously, they have a database in th application.

- At the beginning, the project wiil manage only applications that use postgreSQL, but i intend to cover projects with MySQL and MongoDB as a database.

### For the future

I want take advantage of my studies with Javascript frontend, to develop a web application in React. So that it is possible that anyone can use the system to manage their own databases.

- I imagine, that the user would just provide the connection link to it database (generated by heroku) and so the user will have access to generate common sql scripts and also access to run their own sql scripts.
